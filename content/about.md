I'm a Software Developer with solid experience in **Go**, **Java**, and **Python**, focused on building **scalable, distributed systems** with high availability and low latency. I specialize in **microservices architecture**, **clean code**, and **robust API integration**, applying patterns like **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture**.

I hold a **degree in Control and Automation Engineering**, a **postgraduate certification in Go (Full Cycle)**, and I'm currently pursuing a **postgraduate program in Java Architecture and Development at FIAP**.

Over the past **10+ years**, Iâ€™ve worked on mission-critical systems in **e-commerce**, **logistics**, and **industrial automation**, using tools like **Datadog**, **Grafana**, and **LabVIEW**, while collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software.

I'm fluent in **English** and **Portuguese**, with a growth mindset and a passion for clean, reliable solutions.
