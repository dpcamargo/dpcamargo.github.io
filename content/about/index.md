I'm a Software Developer with solid experience in **Go**, **Java**, and **Python**, focused on building **scalable, distributed systems** with high availability and low latency.

I hold a **degree in Control and Automation Engineering**, a **postgraduate certification in Go** by [Full Cycle](https://goexpert.fullcycle.com.br/pos-goexpert/), and I'm currently pursuing a **postgraduate program in Java Architecture and Development** at [FIAP](https://postech.fiap.com.br/curso/arquitetura-desenvolvimento-java).
