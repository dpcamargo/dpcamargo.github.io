I'm a Software Developer with solid experience in **Go**, **Java**, and **Python**, focused on building **scalable, distributed systems** with high availability and low latency.

I hold a **degree in Control and Automation Engineering**, a **postgraduate certification in Go by <a href="https://goexpert.fullcycle.com.br/pos-goexpert/" target="_blank">Full Cycle</a>**, and I'm currently pursuing a **postgraduate program in Java Architecture and Development at <a href="https://postech.fiap.com.br/curso/arquitetura-desenvolvimento-java" target="_blank">FIAP</a>**.
